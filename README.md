### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Carlos Navarro, I am a masters student whose incredibly passionate about all things engineering, robotics & artificial intelligence. 

I oriented my degree towards robotics and artificial intelligence because I think that to succeed in this field one must have a strong engineering background, computer science knowledge and a good mathematical & programming foundation. 

During my undergraduate career I dedicated my time to develop a strong foundation in  mechanical engineering, and study core subjects such as dynamics, controls, and programming. It was during that time that I dived into the world of robotics & artificial intelligence. 

After graduation I decided to take a step  into autonomy, artificial intelligence & robotics, mixing engineering with computer science 
I began to take graduate level computer science courses in: Neural Networks, Deep Learning & Machine Learning.
Mechanical & Electrical courses on topics like: Mechatronics, Electromechanical systems & Intelligent systems. 
I also did a minor in mathematics during my undergrad that has helped me understand machine learning more deeply.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... Artifial Intelligence & Robotics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Graduate Level: Deep Learning & Machine Learning
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... AI, Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects
